living organisms are open systems that survive by transforming energy and decreasing their local entropy to maintain a stable and vital condition defined as homeostasissubdisciplines of biology are defined by the research methods employed and the kind of system studied theoretical biology uses mathematical methods to formulate quantitative models while experimental biology performs empirical experiments to test the validity of proposed theories and understand the mechanisms underlying life and how it appeared and evolved from nonliving matter about 4 billion years ago through a gradual increase in the complexity of the system
