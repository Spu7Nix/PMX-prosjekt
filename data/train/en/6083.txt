in order of increasing frequency and decreasing wavelength these are radio waves microwaves infrared radiation visible light ultraviolet radiation xrays and gamma rayselectromagnetic waves are emitted by electrically charged particles undergoing acceleration and these waves can subsequently interact with other charged particles exerting force on them
