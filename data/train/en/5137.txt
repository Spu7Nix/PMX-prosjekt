in classical mechanics as quantified from a stationary frame of reference the motive power of a jetpropelled vehicle is the product of the engine thrust and the velocity of the vehicle note that by this definition a propelled vehicle hovering at stationary elevation over a gravitational body where the upward thrust exactly cancels the downward acceleration of gravity the motive power is zero
